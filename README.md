Welcome to our repository focused on predicting real estate property prices. We've meticulously implemented and rigorously tested a suite of machine learning regression models, including Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Ensemble techniques like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest.

Our analysis revolves around leveraging these models on a unified dataset to forecast property prices based on crucial features such as size, room count, and more. This comprehensive exploration aimed to fine-tune predictive accuracy specifically for housing price estimation.

Through exhaustive evaluations and careful parameter tuning via grid search methodologies, we've sought to identify the best parameter sets tailored to our dataset's characteristics.

Our findings highlight the exceptional effectiveness of tree-based models and ensemble techniques when compared to other methods. Delve into our repository to explore our expedition and extract insights into the most efficient strategies for predicting real estate prices.
